## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE project01;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,	
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,	
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);


2. Data Exploration & Cleaning
Record Count ‚Äì Count total records.
Customer Count ‚Äì Find unique customers.
Category Count ‚Äì Identify unique product categories.
Null Value Check ‚Äì Detect and delete records with nulls

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

-- Delete null records
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date IS NULL 
   OR sale_time IS NULL 
   OR customer_id IS NULL 
   OR gender IS NULL 
   OR age IS NULL 
   OR category IS NULL 
   OR quantity IS NULL 
   OR price_per_unit IS NULL 
   OR cogs IS NULL;



## 3. Business Analysis & SQL Queries


### 1. Retrieve all columns for sales made on `2022-11-05`
```sql
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';


2. Retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022
